    <p>Welcome in my website, arbazapp, i am <b>Arbaz Sheikh</b> from Mahuva City </p>

    <p>most of people start learning programming language and want to become a good web developer but the reality is that everybody can learn web programming easily but they cannot develop a scalable quality client oriented web application withuot spending
        some years in web development field as junior develoepr or assistant of senior developer</p>

    <button class="button_1" onclick="apicall('media/data/home/about/arbaz.html','.article')">Aboute Me</button>

    <div>

        <p> in this website we will learn how to develop scalable and client-oriented web application through using HTML + CSS + JAVASCRIPT + PHP and MYSQL</p>
        <p><b>HTML</b> creates structure of webpage , you can think it like a car it's structure decides by html, <b>CSS</b> helps add style (visually attractive things) such color, background color, font type, align and position and much more , you can
            think as car's design and appearance is made by css, <b>JAVASCRIPT</b> adds interactivity and the power of coding in your website that can transform your website into web application if you coding properly well organized manner</p>

        <p>we can Develop website or web application through using just front-end technology such HTML + CSS + JAVASCRIPT but we can't store data on server by using javascript because it is a client-side programming , to store user's data we have to use
            server-side scripting which is <b>PHP</b> that helps developers to work on server</p>
        <p>php is great programming language for web development on server side but storing data through php in a simple file is not a good idea, to make storing data easier and make secure with bring data faster develoeprs use database whcih stores data
            in organized manner that is mysql that we will learn on this website</p>
